    What makes SHAB better than other solutions such as MegaUHB or AppStore ad-blocking apps you ask?
                                    <br>
    In a nutshell: Faster browsing, better battery life and auto-updating… But how?
<br>
    <br>
    The problem with ad-blocking tweaks like MegaUHB is that they rely on hosts file modifications to block ads... Not only is this static, requiring constant manual additions to the file and pushes of Cydia package updates (rarely done) but it also takes a toll on your download/upload speed...<br><br>
                                    
                                    The more rules in the hosts file, the longer it takes to load pages/download information. This method also requires additional tweaks (LetMeBlock) to allow mDNSresponder’s use of the hosts file.
                                    <br><br>This is also a strain on system daemons which causes a significant amount of battery drain, especially if mDNSresponder goes haywire, which it’s known to do.

<br>
    <br>
    That’s where TutuBoxHelper + SHAB comes in...
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Security is a top priority for everyone... TutuBoxHelper + SHAB ensures that remains top of the list. That's why we don't use third-party Proxy servers, for example, ffapple... Who knows who is looking at all of your traffic when using that?! And then there's the third-party DNS apps like DNSCloak where your traffic is again, routed through a third-party (DNS) server. TutuBoxHelper + SHAB is different in that everything is proxied ON YOUR OWN DEVICE. Unlike the others, EVERYTHING is in plain-text so you're able to view exactly how TutuBoxHelper + SHAB works and what it's doing.
                                    <br><br>
                                TutuBoxHelper + SHAB is a simple configuration profile that uses JavaScript to check against specified rules in a PAC. If the domain requested is within the PAC's list, it will route to a blackhole.
                                    <br><br>This method doesn’t use any additional system resources, does not modify any system files, provides on-the-fly updates with the most trusted ad-blocking list and works on all versions of iOS, all carriers and ISP’s...
                                    <br><br>TutuBoxHelper + SHAB aims at blocking as many ads as possible out of the box but, naturally, new ad servers are used on a daily basis.<br><br>If you come across ads on a website or while using an app, please use the AdReport! app to submit a report to us so we can block it ASAP! The more that use this feature, the better!<br><br>New ad servers that are added to SHAB will be updated automatically on your device, providing constant up-to-date protection by the minute.

    <br>
    The profile requires your iDevice be managed/supervised.
    This is a restriction set in place by Apple on a system level due to the nature of the profile.
<br>
    <br>
                                    <b>Jailbroken users:</b> This package will spoof your devices “isSupervised” status allowing easy installation. <br>On removal of this package, your device will return to its true unsupervised state. <br><i>While installed, to remove the “This iPhone is supervised and managed.” message in Settings, please install “isSupervisedBeGone” after installation.</i>
<br>
    <br>
                                    <b>Stock users:</b> You will have to manually supervise/manage your device using Apple Configurator 2 (Mac only) prior to installation.
                                    <br><b><i>This requires restoring your device</i></b> in order to configure/supervise so <b><i>please ensure to backup</b></i> your device prior to supervising/managing with Apple Configurator 2.
<br>
    <br>
    You can remove this profile at any time by navigating to Settings - General - Profiles & Device Management.
